# Personal-Website
A repository used to contain my portfolio website content. The website includes a brief introduction of myself, my contacts, and some projects I've been working on in my free time.

Check out the deployed website here: https://vericks101.github.io/Personal-Website/

## Local Setup and Configuration
This website is hooked up to GitHub Pages and is deployed as such. If the website needs to be run locally, utilizing a local server host is an option or tools such as Live Server within Visual Studio Code.
